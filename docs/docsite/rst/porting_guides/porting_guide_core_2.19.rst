We suggest you read this page along with `ansible-core Changelog for 2.19 <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/stable-2.19/changelogs/CHANGELOG-v2.19.rst>`_ to understand what updates you may need to make.

Plugins
=======

* The ``ssh`` connection plugin now supports using ``SSH_ASKPASS`` to supply passwords
  for authentication as an alternative to the ``sshpass`` program. The default is to use
  ``SSH_ASKPASS`` instead of ``sshpass``. This is controlled by the ``password_mechanism``
  configuration for the ``ssh`` connection plugin. To switch back to using ``sshpass``
  make one of the following changes:

  To your ``ansible.cfg`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

     [ssh_connection]
     password_mechanism = sshpass

  By exporting an environment variable:

  .. code-block:: shell

     export ANSIBLE_SSH_PASSWORD_MECHANISM=sshpass

  By setting the following variable:

  .. code-block:: yaml

     ansible_ssh_password_mechanism: sshpass
